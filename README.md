# Auotomated-essay-grading
The project aims to build an automated essay scoring system using a data set of 16173 essays from kaggle.com. The essay set contained of 8 different types of essays based on different contexts. We extracted features such as total word count per essay, removed stopwords, word lemmatizer,etc from the training set essays. We used RNN for defining layers and XGBClassifier model to learn from these features and generate parameters for testing and validation. We used Bi-directional LSTM for better model performance. Further, we performed testing on dataset for 3 times each time dropping different parameters for better accuracy. The Grading style used 4 parameters i.e. worst, average, above average, excellent for grading essays based on clarity and coherence. Categorical encoders were used for encoding these categorical parameters into numeric values. Sequence matrix was used convert tokenized text of max length 50 into matrix. We get an array of four values which are nothing but probability scores for values from 0 to 3 and the highest value is considered as graded score for the particular essay.
